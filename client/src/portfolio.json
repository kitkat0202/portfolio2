The most notable achievement on this project was the use of Holochain technology as the backend integrating with a ReactJS front end. As Holochain was only an Alpha version, it was a difficult learning curve to get setup and started. I personally would not recommend using Holochain until a more stable version (with an easier setup method) is out, however it was fun to learn. My favorite part (and the part I was most involved with) is the React front end. It is a sleek dark design with a multilayered data filter mechanism that I am most proud of.",

After creating the task another user can add to the 'task' worth to up the value of this task, so the question can be answered quicker or more users from the community can contribute to the 'task'.
