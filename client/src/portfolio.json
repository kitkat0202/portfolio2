The most notable achievement on this project was the use of Holochain technology as the backend integrating with a ReactJS front end. As Holochain was only an Alpha version, it was a difficult learning curve to get setup and started. I personally would not recommend using Holochain until a more stable version (with an easier setup method) is out, however it was fun to learn. My favorite part (and the part I was most involved with) is the React front end. It is a sleek dark design with a multilayered data filter mechanism that I am most proud of.",

The use of pebbles is to create 'tasks' for the community to answer/complete. The worth of each 'task' depends on the creator and community. After creating the task another user can add to the 'task' worth to up the value of this task, so the question can be answered quicker or more users from the community can contribute to the 'task'. There is a daily distribution of pebbles for logging in and you can also earn pebbles by answering the 'task' correctly. The pebbles you earn can then be used to create your own tasks."

On top of that there were minor errors that kept popping up and since this was a scraping app Heroku kept showing the 'memory quota exceeded' error since I had the re-test scraping every time, I push new code up. Thinking back on this project, many of the issues could have been avoided if I had just chosen another site to scrape, however I believe that the learning experience I gained from this project was well worth the problems I face then.",
